# Founders and Coders project Twitter and Instagram

Projects I've worked on while on the Founders and Coders course (http://foundersandcoders.org/)
This project is to create an app which allows user to search Twitter and Instagram and then displays pictures based on their query. Uses MongoDB to store and serve data quickly and runs on Node.js server.
